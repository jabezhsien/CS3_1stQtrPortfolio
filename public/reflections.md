# **Q1 End-of-Lessons Reflections**
by **RARA, Jabez Hsien G.** of *9-Magnesium*


### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. Basic HTML Structure - My old school already taught me how to use HTML back in Grade 7. I had to relearn how HTML works in order to use it efficiently for Computer Science 3. It wasn't that hard, in my opinion. I had a fun time using HTML again because it reminded me of my time in my old school. The logic behind basic HTML was easy enough for me to relearn quickly.

2. HTML Tags - This was easy for me because I didn't need to learn any new HTML tags for Computer Science 3. I just needed to remember how each HTML tag worked and what it was used for. I also needed in what section of the code they can/should be placed in order to get the right HTML structure.

3. JavaScript Event Handlers - We only used one type of event handler for the first Quarter. I just need to understand how they work and how to call them into the function. I still studied the different types of event handlers just in case we need them for future topics.

4. JavaScript Basic Statements - They were a bit more complex than C++ statements, but I managed to get a good grasp on how to use them. At first, I was a bit confused, but after some activities it became a lot easier. Even though I haven't encountered them yet in any of my previous Computer Science lessons, there wasn't taht much to learn about it.

5. Variable Declaration - In my opinion, this was the easiest of the JavaScript topics discussed in class. I just needed to remember the definition of the data types that are to be used. The variable declaration and JavaScript operator topics are closely related, so it was easy for me to understand both of them.
### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The 'why' should be per topic listed.

1. JavaScript Operators - The way the operators is similar to how C++ operators work. I learned this back in Grade 8 in my old school. However, I still struggle on applying them when it comes to hard prompts like sequences or patterns. The basics are easy, but harder applications will require me to think harder and critically which I still need practice with.

2. Loop Structures - They're easy to understand at the basic level. However, when it comes to harder prompts that involve nested loops, I usually fail in properly making codes that satisfy the prompt. I also don't do well when it comes to understanding the process behind the loops and how a small change in syntax can change the entire output of the code.

3. If-else Strutures - I used to enjoy this topic back in Computer Science 2. When I started learning about this in Computer Science 3, I was shocked to find out how much harder it actually is. The code is similar to C++ version, but the application is what confuses me sometimes.

4. Ternary Operators - When I first saw this in class, I had absolutely NO idea what I was looking at. After attending Ma'am Aline's consultation, I managed to get a good grasp on the topic. However, I'm afraid I still need more practice on this to properly use it in my future codes.

5. Pre/post-increment & Pre/Post-decrement - This topic was also new to me coming into Computer Science 3. I had to search online how to use Pre/post-increment and Pre/Post-decrement in my code. I can understand the basics of this topic, but I still need more practice with it before I can use it in my code.

6. Functions - This was the hardest topic in the first Quarter, in my opinion. Even if it was just debugging, there were so many aspects to consider, and I couldn't find the errors quickly and what sections needs revising.

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. When I encounter a concept I cannot understand immediately, I would try to search online for examples and resouces that would help me grasp the topic better.

2. If that won't work, then I will consult some of my classmates who are probably proficient in coding. 

3. Lastly, if my classmates are no help as well, I will need to reserve a consultation with Ma'am Aline so that she can teach me the topic face-to-face.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. I don't think the **Speedtest** was helpful for the class. It favors the students who are already experts at coding, and neglects those who still need practice and time.

2. The **Kahoot** exercises were helpful because it fostered healthy competition while Ma'am Aline also gave us an explanation as to how the JavaScript code works objectively.

3. The **Graded Exercises** were helpful because it allowed us to work in our own personal and private space to work on the activity individually. It also functions as a reviewer to the topics previously discussed in the meetings before.

4. **Pre-tests** weren't helpful because they checked our proficiency in a topic we haven't discussed yet. Of course they assess our individual thinking skills, but I think we should dive into the lesson immediately to avoid wasting time.
